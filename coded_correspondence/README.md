## 📌 Project Description
This project explores classical cryptography techniques by implementing message encoding and decoding systems.  
It focuses on the **Caesar Cipher** and the **Vigenère Cipher**, two fundamental ciphers in cryptography, to understand substitution-based encryption methods.

The project includes:
1. **Caesar Cipher**  
   - Encode and decode messages with a given shift.  
   - Brute-force decryption by trying all possible shifts.  
   - Apply multiple Caesar shifts for stronger encryption.  

2. **Vigenère Cipher**  
   - Encode and decode messages using a keyword.  
   - Demonstrates polyalphabetic substitution where each letter has a variable shift.
