# U.S. Medical Insurance Costs

## üìå Project Description
This project analyzes a dataset of U.S. medical insurance costs.  
The goal is to explore how different factors (age, sex, BMI, children, smoking habits, and region) affect insurance charges.

Two different approaches were implemented:
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:  
   - Built a `PatientInfo` class to encapsulate patient attributes and provide methods for analysis.
   - Implemented functions for calculating averages, regional distributions, and insurance costs.
2. **Pandas-based Analysis**:  
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using `pandas` and `numpy`.
   - Cleaned the dataset (handling duplicates, checking missing values).
   - Visualized relationships (e.g., smoking vs. BMI, smoking vs. charges).
