# ðŸŒª Hurricane Analysis  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
This project analyzes historical Category 5 hurricanes using Python fundamentals.  
The goal is to clean and organize hurricane data, then build custom functions to extract insights such as damages, deaths, and affected areas.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Features / Methods  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Converted raw damage estimates (e.g., "$100M", "$1B") into numerical values.  

2. **Data Organization**  
   - Structured hurricane information (name, year, max wind, deaths, damages, affected areas) into dictionaries.  

3. **Custom Analysis Functions**  
   - Identify the **deadliest hurricane**.  
   - Find the **most costly hurricane**.  
   - Count how many times each area was affected.  
   - Classify hurricanes by **mortality rate** (low â†’ catastrophic).  
   - Classify hurricanes by **damage scale**.

## ðŸ“š Technologies Used 
- Python 3  
- Core data structures: lists, dictionaries, loops, conditionals, string manipulation  

---

## âœ¨ Key Learnings  
- Practiced breaking down complex problems into smaller, reusable functions.  
- Learned to represent real-world disasters in structured data formats.  
- Gained experience in categorizing and analyzing disaster data without external libraries.
