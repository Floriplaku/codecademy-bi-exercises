# üìä Codecademy BI & Python Mini-Projects

## üìå Repository Description
This repository contains a collection of mini-projects completed during the Codecademy **Business Intelligence & Python** track.  
Each project focuses on different aspects of **data analysis, statistics, and programming fundamentals**, combining both Python and data science concepts.

The projects are structured to demonstrate:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Cryptography fundamentals
- Funnel analysis and business metrics
- Usage of Python data structures (lists, dictionaries, classes)

## üìÇ Projects Included

1. **U.S. Medical Insurance Costs**
   - Two approaches:
     - **OOP approach**: `PatientInfo` class to encapsulate patient attributes and compute statistics.
     - **Pandas approach**: EDA with data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.
   - Explores how age, sex, BMI, children, smoking, and region affect insurance charges.

2. **Hurricane Analysis**
   - Analysis of Category 5 hurricanes.
   - Functions to clean damage data, organize hurricanes by year/area, and calculate impact by deaths and damages.
   - Demonstrates working with **functions, dictionaries, and loops**.

3. **Coded Correspondence**
   - Cryptography mini-project.
   - Implements **Caesar Cipher** and **Vigen√®re Cipher** for encoding/decoding messages.
   - Demonstrates fundamentals of **string manipulation, modular arithmetic, and brute-force decryption**.

4. **Python Dictionaries ‚Äì Medical Insurance**
   - Practice with Python dictionaries and list comprehensions.
   - Stores and analyzes patient insurance data.
   - Focus on **dictionary operations** and **list comprehension**.

5. **Page Visits Funnel Project**
   - Funnel analysis using web log data (`visits`, `cart`, `checkout`, `purchase`).
   - Calculates conversion rates at each step of the funnel.
   - Demonstrates real business metrics: **cart abandonment rate** and **average time to purchase**.

## üìà Outcome
These mini-projects serve as a foundation in:
- Writing clean and structured Python code,
- Performing data analysis with Pandas,
- Interpreting real-world business and statistical data,
- Building confidence in both technical and analytical problem-solving.
